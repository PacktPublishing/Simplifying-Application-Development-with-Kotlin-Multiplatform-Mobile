   sourceSets["main"].manifest.srcFile
    ("src/androidMain/AndroidManifest.xml")
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion(23)
        targetSdkVersion(30)
    }
}
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for native Android and iOS developers who want to build high-quality apps using an efficient development process. Knowledge of the framework and the languages used is necessary, that is, Android with Java or Kotlin and iOS with Objective-C or Swift. For Swift developers, the book assumes no knowledge of Kotlin as this will be covered in the context of Swift.
